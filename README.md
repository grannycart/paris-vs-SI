# Paris vs Staten Island

## To do:
* Figure out how to resolve different coordinate systems between NYC and Paris layers
	* My first experiment left the Paris subway system bigger than NYC as a whole. 
		* Though maybe I was just measuring wrong 
	* Try projecting with the 2nd method that qgis offers you, see if that doesn't throw an error
* Select only Paris subways -- clean up extraneous railyards and stuff
* figure out how to visualise Paris subway lines (colors, continued lines -- reference against actual Paris Metro map colors)
* Rotate lines over SI so they fit as best as they can (show an extended line running to Brooklyn -- something SI *wishes* it had!)

## Moving features:
* turn on the advanced digitizing toolbar
* enable editing on layer
* select features of layer you want to move
* click the Move Feature button
* click on the selected features (maybe? this isn't clear)
* click where you want the features to go
* (still need to work out how this works exactly)
