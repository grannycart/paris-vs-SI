# Paris vs Staten Island

## To do:
* Figure out how to resolve different coordinate systems between NYC and Paris layers
	* My first experiment left the Paris subway system bigger than NYC as a whole. 

## Moving features:
* turn on the advanced digitizing toolbar
* enable editing on layer
* select features of layer you want to move
* click the Move Feature button
* click on the selected features (maybe? this isn't clear)
* click where you want the features to go
* (still need to work out how this works exactly)
