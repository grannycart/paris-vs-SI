# Paris vs Staten Island
A QGIS file that lays the Paris Metro (subways only) over Staten Island in NYC.

## Why?
Because one of my pet-peeves is comparisons between Paris and NYC. It's an apples-to-oranges difference in scale. Even though population comparisons across cities can be challenging because of different notions of what constitutes urbanism, Paris is much smaller than NYC by any measure. For reference (these are all from Wikipedia's list of largest cities):

UN Population estimate:  
NYC: 18,819,000  
Paris: 10,901,000  

City Proper (that's NYC 5 boroughs vs Arrondissements of Paris, which are both completely arbitrary administrative borders that have nothing to do with understanding the economics or shared cultural areas of cities, but if that's what you want):  
NYC: 8,804,190  
Paris: 2,148,271  

By urban area:  
NYC: 21,509,000  
Paris: 11,060,000  

By Metro Area (That's what you are calling "metropolitan statistical areas"):  
NYC: 19,557,311  
Paris: 12,244,807  

It really doesn't matter what stat you choose, as long as you are comparing the same things, Paris is just quite a bit smaller than NYC. It's comparable to Chicago. Which is nothing to scoff at. Chicago is a very large, major population center. Just simply not the same size and NYC, London, or LA.

More qualitatively, I've ridden my bicycle across Paris in a single day, from countryside on one side, through the dead middle, across the Seine, to countryside on the other. If I did the equivalent ride across similar development area in NYC, starting from New Jersey countryside across Manhattan and riding to countryside in CT, it would take at least two days.

## But...
But, _but_, Paris is uniquely dense for a rich European city. Over the whole are of the city proper, it's more dense by far than any other wealthy city. It compares only with other major cities in developing countries. Which is super-interesting and in _that_ way Paris is in a class unto itself. The Paris Metro system is also extremely dense in terms of stops, with many more stops much closer together than other major cities. For _these_ reasons it isn't very useful to compare Paris to NYC (or other cities) on a variety of factors as well.

## And the result?
Check out the good service to NJ, and even to Brooklyn! 

This emphasizes how much smaller Paris is than NYC: you could fit the entire city on Staten Island. On the other hand, you could also imagine Staten Island having the density of Paris. In which case it could be the home of ~2.5 million people, rather than it's current measly 500k.
