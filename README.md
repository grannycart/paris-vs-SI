# Paris vs Staten Island

## To do:
* figure out how to visualise Paris subway lines (colors, continued lines -- reference against actual Paris Metro map colors)
    * Did this (eyeballed only, for most lines, according to colors on Google maps -- who knows what colors they are using though!)
* Add to reddit mapporn

## Note to self: Moving features:
* turn on the advanced digitizing toolbar (from View -> toobars ->)
* enable editing on layer
* select features of layer you want to move
* click the Move Feature button
* click on the selected features (maybe? this isn't clear)
* click where you want the features to go
* (still need to work out how this works exactly)
