# Paris vs Staten Island

## To do:
* figure out how to visualise Paris subway lines (colors, continued lines -- reference against actual Paris Metro map colors)

## Moving features:
* turn on the advanced digitizing toolbar
* enable editing on layer
* select features of layer you want to move
* click the Move Feature button
* click on the selected features (maybe? this isn't clear)
* click where you want the features to go
* (still need to work out how this works exactly)
